#Sway URI Scheme

Use the Sway URI scheme to invoke the Sway application.

**Last modified:**

***Applies to:** Sway for Windows*

This document defines the format of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) for the Sway application for Windows. This URI scheme allows for the Sway application to be invoked with various commands.

##Sway URI scheme syntax

The following is the URI scheme syntax:

<ms-sway>:*<command-argument>*

- *<ms-sway>* - Indicates that Sway is the application to invoke. When Sway for Windows is installed, *ms-sway* is registered with Windows to be the Sway handler.
- *<command-argument>* - A URI might have one or more command arguments, delimited by the ampersand (&) character. When more than one command argument is included in a URI, an ampersand (&) character must separate each command argument from the following command argument. Command arguments vary according to the scenario. One common argument is a Sway identifier.
